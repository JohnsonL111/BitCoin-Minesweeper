\n<b>Game Basics:</b>
        \n\"Totally Accurate ‚Çøitcoin Mining Simulator\‚Äù is a knock-off version of the famous ‚ÄúMinesweeper‚Äù game.
        The game consists of a grid of "blocks" and hidden Bitcoins to be uncovered.

\n\nThe objective of the game is to uncover all the Bitcoins in the fewest number of hashes (scans) of the blocks.
        Hashing (by tapping) a block uncovers it, and determines if there is an unmined Bitcoin.
        \n\nIf the block contains a Bitcoin, the block reveals it.
        If there isn‚Äôt, then the block will initiate a scan that sweeps adjacent rows and columns, and displays the number of Bitcoins found in the scan of the adjacent rows and columns.

\n\nTapping on a <i>revealed</i> Bitcoin will also initiate a scan to search adjacent rows and columns for any Bitcoins as well.
        Tapping on already scanned empty blocks or already scanned revealed Bitcoins will not initiate another scan.
